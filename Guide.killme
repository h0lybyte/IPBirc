IPBirc - IRC Chat option with IPB Auth [IPBWI/ircd.js]

This is just experimental, running a real ircd (athens/anope) would be better! However, if you like to mess around and learn, this was a great way to understand how to integrate IPB authentication protocol with ircd.js!

First go ahead and make sure curl, git, npm and nodejs are installed! Afterwards, I would suggest not running this inside root! Maybe run it inside its own openvz container?

Here is a generic setup guide that is designed to confuse you and discourage you from doing anything productive in your life! Yase!


Repo: https://github.com/h0lybyte/IPBirc

Step 0) Create a jail environment, I suggest running ubuntu / openvz container, most likely 4gb of ram, (download more if you need), bind the ip to its own private vlan, and only forward port 6667. (for now, if you want to add ssl, I believe its 6677) ~ in this case, lets say my IRC is running inside the vlan with the IP of 10.21.21.5. Go ahead and ping it, so you can move forward!

Step 1) apt-get upgrade , apt-get update, apt-get install yum? heh

Step 2) Google a guide on how to install the latest nodejs 5.x ? Probably want to make sure you have a nice npm environment too.
might look like nodejs.org at some path like, /en/download/package-manager, idk man, just google it.

Step 3) cd into /var/irc/ , then git-clone the repo: https://github.com/h0lybyte/IPBirc 

Step 4) Go back into your IPB box, which you should have inside its own jailed container, lets say I run it on 10.21.21.penis. Once inside, you should make sure you have IPBWI ready! Copy the irc.php into your IPB box and be sure that the locations for the required files match! This step is the one that won't make sense to anyone on HF besides maybe a couple people, so you might be fucked.

Step 5) Switch back to the IRC box, then go inside the command.js file, ctrl+f for 10.21.21 ip range, then replace that with 10.21.21.penis (or whatever the internal network IP is for your IPB box).

Step 6) cd into your bin folder , then run the irc.js file. Boom, your node-js irc should be up and running! Now to connect, the username is your IPB username and the server password is a string that is formatted like
username:password

So if your username was, f4ck_this_thread and your password was h0ly is a fag00t , it be formated like "f4ck_this_thread:h0ly is a fag00t ".

Step 7) Login!
